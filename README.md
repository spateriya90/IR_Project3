Tuning Solr for Relevance By Evaluating IR Models

Evaluated the performance of IR Models like VSM, BM25 and DFR, and tuning each of them to give the best relevance in the results on a Solr instance for given queries. Also explored various query processing techniques such as query expansion, boosting of fields, phrase matching, translation and synonyms, to achieve a measured performance improvement evidenced by MAP, nDCG and F Measure.
